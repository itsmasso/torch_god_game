/*
How it works:
- Creates a grid and list of spawn points inside various cells
- Each spawn point created will have a radius around a point (circle around a point)
- Each cell's diagonal length will be equal to a point's radius
    - Because of this, there is only enough room for ONE point per cell and we can determine the cell size

- The purpose is that a point's radius zone cannot exceed a 5x5 block of cells, so we only need to check whether a point lies in the block of cells or not
